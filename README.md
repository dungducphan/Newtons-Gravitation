# Newton's law of universal gravitation

This simulation uses the famous equation of Isaac Newton (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation) 
which is based heavily on Kapler's previous work (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler).

The maths itself is quite simple (but I think there could be a more efficient way to do the integration). The trick of bringing 
movement into the simulation is to put a small initial force vector for each generated planets.

This simulation is of course not 100% realistic since some assumptions were made. But I hope it is still a good fun to look 
at how celestial bodies move around :)
